      "these phases, the data requested is comes from the cloud \n",
      "as most of the date stored direc tly into the cloud. So, the \n",
      "latency of the system is at stake compared to the non cloud \n",

      "behaves differently in the cloud and the non cloud \n",
      "environment which is the study taken i n this work. In this \n",
      "work, we have had many assumptions like speed of the \n",

      "requirement of India, but the same work can be extended \n",
      "to other parts of the world for higher speeds  and suitably \n",
      "the performance me trics can be measured for that. Also in \n",
